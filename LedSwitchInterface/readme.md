Interface of LED and Switch
Main purpose of this code is to learn GPIOs interfacing

1) Make PE1 an output and make PE0 an input. 
2) The system starts with the LED on (make PE1 =1). 
3) Wait about 100 ms
4) If the switch is pressed (PE0 is 1), then toggle the LED once, else turn the LED on. 
5) Steps 3 and 4 are repeated over and over.
